  <p>The original plan for my portfolio website was simple and predictable: I would pick out a nice Jekyll theme that played well with GitHub Pages, and would use GitHub Pages to create and develop my portfolio site. I had done this before with a different project, and my experience was that it is not as easy as it sounds, because the Jekyll themes are never quite what you expect and they do take some tweaking to get them where you want, but it's still relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>The difficulty, however, was that I decided that I wanted the writing samples page to be password-protected. Some of the samples document products that still exist but that have updated significantly, and I don't want to increase the probability of out-of-date documentation out there in the world. (I spend enough time as a technical writer on that particular task.) Some are draft PDFs generated in Oxygen or MadCap Flare and aren't nicely formatted, and I'm sure my former employers wouldn't want an ugly copy of their lovely branded content floating around. It's good to be cautious.</p>

<p>After research and consultation, I realized that I wouldn't be able to pursue my original portfolio development and publishing plan if I also wanted that single password-protected page. I considered other scenarios -- WordPress, plain old HTML -- and finally found a workable solution, which is what you see here.</p>

<p>As planned, I did start with a Jekyll theme -- in this case, [Typewriter](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/typewriter). It's a fun theme that didn't require a lot of editing on my end. My files are sourced in a Git repo on a private server, and I upload copies to the kernion.me site. I use a text editor to edit the content and configuration pages, and I use Jekyll to preview them locally.</p>
